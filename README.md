# Discord_GameSDK_Unity_Template
a comprehensive template on utilizing discord's latest GameSDK (v3.2.1 at the time of writing) with unity.
with the one script, it SHOULD explain how to use several Discord GameSDK's features such as:

- example use on updating discord activity status
- example setup so you can send join invites
- example method for getting the avatar and placing it into a sprite (needs work honestly)
- also helps with the whole "unity  being open wont clear discord status"
- Comments on almost every method and variable for as much explanation i can give.

also it's pretty self managable, for any reason you may need to restart the script provides a void called RefreshDiscord() which will cleanly delete the script and start a new one for you.
